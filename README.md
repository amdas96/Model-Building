# Model-Building

1: Predicting CPU User Mode Time:

Context:
The comp-activ database captures various performance metrics of computer systems. The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory, used in a multi-user university environment for tasks including internet access, file editing, and CPU-intensive applications.

As an aspiring data scientist, the objective is to develop a linear regression model to predict the percentage of time CPUs operate in user mode (usr). You will analyze the influence of different system attributes on the usr metric.

2: Predicting Contraceptive Use

Context:
The Republic of Indonesia Ministry of Health has collected data from a Contraceptive Prevalence Survey involving 1473 married females who were either not pregnant or uncertain of their pregnancy status. Your role as a statistician is to predict whether these women use a contraceptive method based on their demographic and socio-economic attributes.

Objective:
Develop a classification model to predict whether a woman uses a contraceptive method based on her socio-economic and demographic attributes.
